# Product Requirements Document: pcap-decoder-ts

**Author:** Trae AI
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Version:** 1.0

## 1. Introduction

`pcap-decoder-ts` is a TypeScript library designed for parsing PCAP (Packet Capture) and PCAPng files and decoding various network protocols. Its primary goal is to provide developers with a robust, efficient, and easy-to-use tool for network traffic analysis, security research, and network application development directly within JavaScript/TypeScript environments (Node.js and Browser).

## 2. Goals

- **Comprehensive Parsing:** Accurately parse PCAP and PCAPng file formats, including global headers and individual packet records.
- **Extensible Protocol Decoding:** Provide decoders for common network protocols (Ethernet, IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, DNS, HTTP) and allow users to easily add custom decoders for other protocols.
- **Structured Output:** Present decoded packet data in a clear, structured, and easily accessible format (e.g., JSON objects).
- **High Performance:** Optimize for speed and memory efficiency to handle large capture files.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Ensure functionality in both Node.js and modern web browser environments.
- **Developer-Friendly API:** Offer a simple and intuitive API for ease of integration and use.

## 3. Target Users

- Network Engineers and Administrators
- Cybersecurity Analysts and Researchers
- Developers building network monitoring or analysis tools
- Educators and Students in networking courses

## 4. Core Features

### 4.1. PCAP/PCAPng File Parsing

- Support for standard PCAP file format.
- Support for PCAPng file format (including multiple interface types, name resolution blocks, etc.).
- Extraction of global header information (e.g., magic number, version, timezone, snaplen, link-layer header type).
- Iteration over packet records, extracting packet headers and data.
- Timestamp handling and conversion.

### 4.2. Protocol Decoding

- **Layer 2:** Ethernet II
- **Layer 3:** IPv4, IPv6, ARP, ICMPv4, ICMPv6
- **Layer 4:** TCP, UDP
- **Application Layer (Initial Support):** DNS (basic query/response), HTTP (request/response headers, common methods)
- Ability to identify and chain decoders based on protocol numbers/types (e.g., EtherType, IP Protocol Number, TCP/UDP Port numbers).
- Graceful handling of unknown or malformed protocols.
- Payload access for undecoded protocols.

### 4.3. Data Output and Accessibility

- Packets represented as JavaScript/TypeScript objects.
- Clear separation of protocol layers within the packet object.
- Access to raw packet bytes and decoded fields.
- Helper functions for common data interpretations (e.g., IP address formatting, port number to service name mapping - optional).

### 4.4. Extensibility

- Well-defined interface for creating and registering custom protocol decoders.
- Mechanism to prioritize or override existing decoders.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

### 5.1. Performance

- Efficient parsing of large PCAP files (e.g., >1GB) without excessive memory consumption.
- Low-latency decoding for real-time or near real-time applications (where applicable).
- Optimized for common use cases (e.g., iterating through all packets, filtering by protocol).

### 5.2. Reliability and Robustness

- Accurate parsing and decoding according to protocol specifications.
- Resilience to malformed packets and corrupted PCAP files (e.g., skip corrupted packets with warnings).
- Comprehensive error handling and reporting.

### 5.3. Usability

- Clear and comprehensive documentation (API reference, usage examples, tutorials for custom decoders).
- Simple installation and integration into TypeScript/JavaScript projects.
- Type definitions for all public APIs and data structures.

### 5.4. Maintainability

- Modular codebase with clear separation of concerns (parsing, decoding, utilities).
- Comprehensive unit and integration tests.
- Adherence to TypeScript best practices and coding standards.

### 5.5. Security

- No execution of arbitrary code from PCAP data.
- Careful handling of input data to prevent vulnerabilities (e.g., denial of service through malformed packets).

## 6. Technical Considerations

- **Language:** TypeScript (compiles to JavaScript for broad compatibility).
- **Environment:** Node.js (LTS versions) and modern Web Browsers (via bundlers like Webpack/Rollup/Vite).
- **Dependencies:** Minimize external dependencies to keep the package lightweight. Consider using native `Buffer` and `DataView` for byte manipulation.
- **Testing:** Utilize a testing framework like Jest or Vitest.
- **Build System:** `tsc` for compilation, potentially with a bundler for browser distribution.
- **Modularity:** Design the library so that users can import only the necessary parts (e.g., only the PCAP parser without all decoders if not needed).

## 7. Future Considerations (Out of Scope for v1.0)

- Advanced PCAPng features (e.g., decryption blocks).
- Stream reassembly (e.g., TCP stream reconstruction).
- Advanced application layer protocol decoders (e.g., TLS handshake, detailed HTTP/2, QUIC).
- Packet filtering capabilities within the library.
- Writing/creating PCAP files.
- Integration with visualization libraries.

## 8. Success Metrics

- Adoption by developers (npm downloads, GitHub stars/forks).
- Positive feedback on ease of use and performance.
- Successful integration into various networking applications.
- Low bug report rate.
- Community contributions (e.g., new protocol decoders).
